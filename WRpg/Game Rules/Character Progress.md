As the game progresses, your character will gain new traits usually through actions done through the course of the game and placed onto your character as a result. These will be placed onto your character by the DM. 

For example, if your character attempts to do things they are not familiar with such as pickpocketing, after a few tries the DM may reward them with a new trait, indicating that they have become more familiar with that particular action, and you will get bonuses to future rolls involving that action.

Another example is after a particularly brutal encounter your character may have suffered an broken leg, and as a result may have a negative effect to their actions such as being unable to run.

It is up to the player and DM to define what each of these tags do, but they are the primary driving force in the game.

You can have as many tags as you would like, but I recommend having between 4-6 that define your character at the beginning of the game.
