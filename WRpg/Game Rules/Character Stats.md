The stats your character has in this game are going to be defined by your DM. Depending on the situation the DM may apply a stat to your character.

## General Stats (WIP)

Limited Stats will start at a value of 0 and then go up to 5. Any stat that is at 0 just doesn't exist on your character. The unique thing about stats is that they don't actually do anything to your character until they reach a value of 5, and at that point an effect may occur.

A common stat that will be typically defined by your DM can be something like Damage. Whenever your character might get hurt, the Damage stat will increase. If it reaches 5 or higher, that specific stat is consumed and resets back to 0, but you will suffer a penalty. 

For example, your character is being attacked by a goblin wielding a sword. He is already at 4 Damage, and the goblin succeeds in hitting you, causing your Damage stat to reach 5. At that point your Damage will reset to 0, but you will take a critical wound in the process, and get a tag defined by your DM, which in this case will be "Bleeding", which will have gameplay effects such as periodically causing your character to take damage over time, or some other effect that will be defined by your dungeon master.

## Other Stats
