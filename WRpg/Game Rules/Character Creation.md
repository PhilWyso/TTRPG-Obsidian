Your character defines who you are playing as in the game. You will spend the entire game role playing as in the game

### Thinking of a background and story

Before going into the mechanical stats of your character, try to imagine how your character grew up, what he has done in his life, and where it has led him to.

An orphan growing up the streets might have had to pickpocket to get the food he wants. A scholar must have been studious, and a farmer must have done a lot of physical labor. Thinking of events that your character has went through will help with defining the tags for him, but more importantly it will help you create and understand your character and what he went through.

### Tags
When creating a character, you will be tasked with defining traits or tags that explain what they can do and competent in. For example, a character with the Athletic tag means he is capable of doing actions relating to running, jumping and climbing with general ease.

These tags can provide your character benefits to them, or maybe negative effects to them as well. The most common way to add these benefits is to add bonuses to your roll if you are doing an action related to that trait. If your character is athletic and familiar with swords and shields, then doing an attack will provide a bonus to their roll.

These tags are completely up to your imagination. They should be things that define who your character is. Something that when combined with other tags will show what your character is strong and familiar in.

Example:
- Human
- Sword and Shield
- Charismatic
- Athletic
- Religious

With these tags, you can sort of start forming the idea that this character might be similar to a paladin. A devout human wielding a sword and shield, charging into battle.
