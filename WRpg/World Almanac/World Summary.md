# Empires Fall and New Rise

This world has seen thousands of empires fall and rise, with their remnants scattering the landscape. Travelers frequently stumble on structures and strange objects unaware of the potential danger. 

Adventurers can travel to these locations or just happen across weird modern machines such as vending machines. The DM is free to have these strange encounters where they try to describe modern machines without modern materials such as plastic

## Spirits

The spirits in the world range from being benevolent to humans, to outright hostile. The majority or docile, keeping to themselves and trying to achieve their own goals.
