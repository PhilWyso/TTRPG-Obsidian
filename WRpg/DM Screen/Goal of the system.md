The goal of the system is to create something that is not bogged down by character creation. I want the player to freely be able to create and progress their character while still being able to tie its features to the gameplay.

Another goal is to make sure this game is on the light weight side on the rules. I want to push the DM to make more decisions on the fly instead of going back into the rule book to figure out some kind of fickle interaction.
