CC is currently scouting the ship area, 
 Going to do a jump scare with a cat when they they do get into the ship, mean while the rest of the crew will have their first real encounter with the alien


Going to setup the game to have two aliens,  the original and the infected Mike. Depending on how it goes I will either make kentaro a helpful strong infected or work against the crew.

I will make the cat attack the drone and hopefully take it down, which forced Ariel to board the ship to unlock the doors. At which point the cat will be a misdirection and Ariel will get attacked by the doctor.

Meanwhile in the mining colony, the other party will end up getting attacked by the other two aliens. Kentaro and the party will try to fend them off.
