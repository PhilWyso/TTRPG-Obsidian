If damaged, the monster will retreat to its portal in the Mine AnteChamber[9], where it will remain for 10 minutes of real time as the yellow goo repairs its injuries. Anyone who comes into direct contact with the yellow goo must make a body save at disadvantage or have their biology slowly rewritten from the inside as the yellow goo attempts to heal and transform them into the monster. The first sign of change is an aversion to water. The victim regains all health and gains advantage on strength checks. However in 2d10 hours they will start to melt losing 1d10 health every 10 minutes until they turns into a puddle of [[Yellow Goo]] from which a monster will spawn out of.
