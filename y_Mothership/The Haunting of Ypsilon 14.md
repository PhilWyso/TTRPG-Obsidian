## The Hook

The basic concept of Ypsilon-14 is that Dr. Ethan Giovanni, while studying a mysterious yellow goo discovered by asteroid miners has woken up an alien at the mining colony and now its killing people.

The player characters have been hired to pick up a package from Dr. Giovanni
- The package contains a sample of the dangerous yellow goo
- Giovanni is infected with the yellow goo and locked inside his ship
- His workstation, where he accidentally woke up the alien and also where I think I'll place the sample container the PCs are supposed to pick up is located down in the mining tunnels.

3 key pieces of information are needed to relay to the party:
- A miner named Mike is missing
- Ethan Giovanni is a scientist who's doing research onsite
- The cast of characters - nine miners + a cat named prince

## The Beginning

- Introduce the players to the initial story, explain that they are a delivery team and have been tasked with picking a package from Ypsilon 14 and delivering it to a research team based in planet Ertai.
- The players will begin on the ship they are traveling on, and will hail Ypsilon-14 where Sonya will respond and provide the docking codes and instructions to land in dock 2
- The ship lands, its mechanical hum now replaced with silence save for the electric buzzing of the CRT monitors.

> The ships doors slowly open for you to see the docks of Ypsilon-14. The floor is primarily metal grates, with a few metal containers strewn around the place. he ship's interior is bathed in a pervasive gloom, with dim, flickering lights casting long, eerie shadows on the metal containers. Your footsteps echo as you walk off the ship, and you wonder why nobody has come out to meet you. In the south corner of the room there is a doorway with a computer terminal to the side of it.
