A splash of [[Yellow Goo]] on the natural cave walls. An empty vaccsuit, slumped in a heap. An ineligible is scorched into the wall word. If a PC tries to examine the word he suffers alien visions and must make a Sanity Save. Either way he learns that the word "SILENCE" is scorched into the wall with a handheld laser cutter that lays discarded nearby.


As the character's fingers make contact with the alien text, an immediate, disorienting wave of cold and static-riddled energy pulses through their body. The air around them thickens, growing oppressive, as the faint hum of the glyphs beneath their touch grows louder, a sound too deep to be heard but too pervasive to ignore. The world begins to distort as if reality itself is warping and bending, slipping through cracks that shouldn’t exist.

Suddenly, the vision fractures, and the character sees flashes of enormous, indescribable entities—shifting, gargantuan forms that exist outside the boundaries of the known universe. Eyes without number blink open across a writhing mass of tendrils and geometric shapes, focusing their gaze upon the character.

Then, suddenly the sensation is gone. But the echo of those eyes remains, lingering in their mind like a shadow that cannot be shaken. The text on the wall is still there, now easily understood to mean "SILENCE".
