A splash of [[Yellow Goo]] on the natural cave walls. An empty vaccsuit, slumped in a heap. An ineligible is scorched into the wall word. If a PC tries to examine the word he suffers alien visions and must make a Sanity Save. Either way he learns that the word "SILENCE" is scorched into the wall with a handheld laser cutter that lays discarded nearby.


As the character's fingers make contact with the alien text, an immediate, disorienting wave of cold and static-riddled energy pulses through their body. The air around them thickens, growing oppressive, as the faint hum of the glyphs beneath their touch grows louder, a sound too deep to be heard but too pervasive to ignore. The world begins to distort as if reality itself is warping and bending, slipping through cracks that shouldnâ€™t exist.
