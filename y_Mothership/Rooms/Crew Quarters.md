Simple bunks in a series of 10 small, individual rooms. 
- The Ceiling Tiles can be easily removed should anyone try, which will reveal a crawlspace with access to the vents
- Sonya's bunk. A lanyard on a wall hook, with a Key Card on it that authorises airlock use when plugged into the workspace computer. There is also a boombox with a stack of cassettes that she sometimes brings into the workspace.
- Ashraf's Bunk. some cheap plastic gachapon toys, a small potted cactus and a set of dice.
- Dana's Bunk. small corner. Religious symbol. Family photo
- Jerome's Bunk. Cute bedspread, handgun under the pillow with a full clip.
- Kantaro's Bunk. Dana's clothes mixed in with Kantaro's laundry. Discarded Tissues beside the bed have [[Yellow Goo]] on them.
- Morgan's bunk. Cache of snacks badly hidden behind a ceiling tile along with a stimpack
- Rie's Bunk. Narcotics supplied by an obliging cargo ship captain. They'll share if you're interested. There's more behind the ceiling tiles.
- Rosa's Bunk. pinup posters and a musky smell.
- Mike's Old Bunk. Cleaned out. A thorough search reveals a cache behind a ceiling tile. An empty squirt bottle used for misting plants, along with a revolver and some ammunition.
- Unclaimed bunk. The bed is more of a couch now, and there's a game console and a small portable cassette player-recorder.
