Natural smooth **BLACK SPACE ROCK** forms a cavern in arches and whrls. Embryonic pus leaks from an empty fleshy pod in the wall, split by a vertical gash. The [[Yellow Goo]] is thick here as it originated here. A small workstation of scientific equipment has been set up enearby. A scanner relays readings from the pod to the heracles and a scrap of paper sits on the desk that reads 0389.
