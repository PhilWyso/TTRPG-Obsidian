Docking Bay 2 on Ypsilon 14 is a cavernous, industrial space, carved directly into the planet's rocky surface and reinforced with layers of heavy metal plating to withstand both the intense pressure from the atmosphere and the volatile space traffic that comes and goes from this remote mining world. The bay hums with energy, a steady pulse of power flowing through its massive systems, ready to handle anything from sleek, agile shuttles to colossal cargo haulers transporting precious minerals extracted from the planetâ€™s depths.

The floor of the docking bay is composed of smooth, durable alloy, scuffed and worn from years of constant use. The space stretches wide, with high, arching ceilings that vanish into shadows above, where the sound of hydraulic mechanisms can be heard periodically, as gantries and cranes shift cargo or reposition ships for their next departure. The walls are a mixture of rough-hewn stone and metallic infrastructure, all utilitarian in design, with large pipes and conduits running along the edges, constantly whirring with the flow of coolant and fuel.

The crew docks here.
