CC is currently scouting the ship area, 
 Going to do a jump scare with a cat when they they do get into the ship, mean while the rest of the crew will have their first real encounter with the alien


Going to setup the game to have two aliens,  the original and the infected Mike. Depending on how it goes I will either make kentaro a helpful strong infected or work against the crew.

I will make the cat attack the drone and hopefully take it down, which forced Ariel to board the ship to unlock the doors. At which point the cat will be a misdirection and Ariel will get attacked by the doctor.

Meanwhile in the mining colony, the other party will end up getting attacked by the other two aliens. Kentaro and the party will try to fend them off. Lots of the squad have weapons, so Im thinking of having two invisible aliens. One will immediately try to kill off [[Sonya]] and the other will attempt to attack the player crew. 

The crew can potentially run away, but one of the monsters will return to the ship. I'm not sure what dib will do, that's up in the air.

The crew can also potentially pickup the package and leave as well. 

The most cinematic option is to destroy the asteroid
