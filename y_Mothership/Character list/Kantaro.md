Kantaro is the burliest of the workers at the station.

He is a rather quie and gentle giant but his silence adds to his stern and intimidating gaze.

Kantaro is infected with the [[Yellow Goo]] but it's only at the earliest stages. He has become deathly afraid of water which causes him to avoid taking showers and as a result he is the smelliest of the bunch.
