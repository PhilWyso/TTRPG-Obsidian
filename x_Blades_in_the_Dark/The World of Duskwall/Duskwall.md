Welcome adventurers, to the grim and shadowed streets of Duskwall (or Duskvol as locals call it). It is a city perched on the edge of the known world, caught between the horror's of the outside and the corruption within. Duskwall is a city of gaslight and shadow, where industrial smog mingles with eldritch mist and the only certainty is the ever-present struggle to survive. As members of a crew of rogues, scoundrels, and outcasts, your fate is not to save the city, but to carve out your own sliver of safety and power in its dangerous underbelly.

Duskwall is a metropolis built upon the bones of the past. Its cobblestone streets are lit by flickering gaslights, its skies darkened by smoke pouring from countless chimneys. Steam engines chug and wine, drawing power form arcane generators that are fueled by refined ectoplasm- harvested from the very ghosts that haunt  the city.

Duskwall is surrounded by a massive lightning field, an arcane barrier maintained by the mysterious [[Sparkwrights]]. It is all that stands between the city and the horrors of the outside world: restless ghosts, twisted demons, and otherworld horrors.

### The nightmare Inside

Even within the lightning field, death is never far. Anyone who dies without proper rites and swift intervention will rise as a hungry ghost - a malevolent spirit driven by rage and hunger. [[The Church of the Final Rest]] deploys its Ravenkeepeers and Executors to monitor deaths and collect the dead before this happens.

Life is precarious, most people are poor and overworked, livining in cramped tenements or shanties. The city's noble houses like the [[Greycloaks]] are deeply entrenched in power, controlling industry, trade and the political machine. They care little for the suffering of the masses, focusing instead on maintaining their status and silencing dissent.

### The Bluecoats

The city's official police force, the [[Bluecoats]] are a corrupt and brutal organization. While they protect the noble districts and keep factories running, the rest of the city is left to fend for themselves. 

### Beyond the Lightning Field

The death-lands lie beyond the lightning field. It is a blighted and haunted wasteland. The air itself is toxic, infused with the corrupted energy of ancient catastrophes. Few dare to venture outside the barrier, and fewer return.

### Ghosts and Demons

Duskwall's magical energies attract all maner of supernatural. Ghosts are restless dead, often malevolent and dangerous. Demons are rare but far more powerful embodying elemental forces or primal chaos. Both are hunted, or potentially recklessly harnessed by individuals.
