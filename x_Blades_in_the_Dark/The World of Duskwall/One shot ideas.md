Premise:
The group has to be a cult

- a wealthy patron has found scripts about an enemy God and has attempted to complete a spell to cause problems
- a higher ranking part of your sect has sent you out on a mission to steal an artifact sacred to your own god
- a high priest eager for promotion has sent out your group on a mission that goes against the cult code in order to put you against the cult and eliminate you
-
