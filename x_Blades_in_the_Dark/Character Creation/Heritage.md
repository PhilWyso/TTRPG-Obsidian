Your character can come from the following locations:

#### Akaros
the largest and most industrialized land in the Imperium, and is home to the capitol city as well as Duskwall itself. They’re known as a diverse conglomeration of cultures that have grown together in close proximity for centuries, somewhat like Europe.

#### Dagger Isles
Home to rootless wanderers. People there often grow up on ships and travel a lot before settling down. They’re known as corsairs and merchants who live without lightning barriers— dealing with spirits in other ways.
