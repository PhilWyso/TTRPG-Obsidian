Your character can come from the following locations:

#### Akaros
the largest and most industrialized land in the Imperium, and is home to the capitol city as well as Duskwall itself. They’re known as a diverse conglomeration of cultures that have grown together in close proximity for centuries, somewhat like Europe.

#### Dagger Isles
If you want to be a rootless wanderer you could be from the Dagger Isles. People there often grow up on ships and travel a lot before settling down. They’re known as corsairs and merchants who live without lightning barriers— dealing with spirits in other ways.

#### Iruvia
If you want to be from a culture considered “foreign” by the locals, you could
be from Iruvia, a rich and powerful desert kingdom far to the south. It’s
another diverse land of varying cultures similar to old Persia, Egypt, and India.

#### Severos
If you want to be from a place considered “wild” by the rest of the empire, you
could be from Severos. Outside the few Imperial settlements, most Severosi
live in nomadic horse-tribes scattered across the blasted deathlands, surviving
within the ruins of ancient arcane fortresses which still repel spirits

#### Skovlan
If you want to be from a marginalized people, you could be from Skovlan,
the island kingdom just across the sea from Doskvol. Skovlan was last to be
brought under Imperial rule, over the course of the 36-year Unity War (which
ended only a few years ago). Many Skovlander refugees who lost their homes
and jobs in the destruction of the war have come to Doskvol seeking new
opportunities.

#### Tycheros
If you want to be weird, you can be from Tycheros. It’s a semi-mythical place,
far away beyond the northern Void Sea. Everyone says that the people there
are part-demon. If you choose Tycherosi heritage, also create a demonic telltale
(like black shark eyes, feathers instead of hair, etc.) that marks your character.
