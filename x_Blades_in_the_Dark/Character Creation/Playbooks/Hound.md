Hounds are good at tracking things down and also long-distance
combat. Play a Hound if you want to choose your battles

### A deadly sharpshooter and tracker

There’s always a need for scoundrels who can find what others want to keep hidden. Whether that’s a deadbeat gambler trying to skip out on their debts, a treacherous informant or witness who’s going to squeal to the Bluecoats, or the trail to a treasure squirreled away in a secret vault—it’s the Hounds that ferret them out. Why have a fair fight, when you can stalk and ambush your prey on your terms? The underworld is your hunting ground. When you play a Hound, you earn xp when you address a challenge with tracking or violence. Take the initiative to hunt down opportunities and targets
for a score and be willing to hurt whoever stands in your way.
Do you see the whole world as potential prey, or do you still care about people?
Which target in the past gave you the most trouble? Why?
