Cutters are good at winning fights, with violence and with intimidation. Play a Cutter if you want to get your way.

### A dangerous and intimidating fighter

In the underworld of the Dusk, there are scoundrels who take what they want at the bloody edge of a blade or with a threatening presence that can stop a man cold. They are the enforcers, the debt collectors, the killers, the leg-breakers, and the thugs, commonly known as Cutters.

Where subtlety fails, swift brutality—and the threat of worse to come—can solve the problem. Or at least turn it into a different kind of problem. When you play a Cutter, you earn XP when you address a challenge with violence or coercion. Go ahead and get up in everyone’s smug faces and tell them who’s boss, then let your blades do the talking if they don’t get the message.

*Do you have a personal code or a line you won’t cross? Do you want to be the boss or do you want to be the enforcer for the boss? How did you acquire your taste for violence and coercion?*
