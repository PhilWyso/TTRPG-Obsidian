Leeches are good at using alchemy and wrecking stuff with sabotage. Play a Leech if you want to be creative with weird tools.

### A saboteur and technician
The world is built on industry, and the underworld is no different. Leeches are the scoundrels who distill the drugs, refine the arcane essences, build the bombs, bandage the wounds, and forge the tools of the criminal trades—and knowing how to make things also means knowing how to break them.

When you play a Leech, you earn xp when you address a challenge with
technical skill or mayhem. Duskwall is a city full of industrial machinery,
spark-crafts, plumbing, and electrical systems for you to bend to your purposes
or sabotage. Get out your tools and get your hands dirty.

*The extensive training that makes a Leech is rare and strange among the*
*disenfranchised underworld class—how did you learn your arts? Which side of*
*the coin do you prefer, the side of creation and restoration, or the side of mayhem*
*and destruction?*
