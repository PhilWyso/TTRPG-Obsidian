Spiders are good at masterminding maneuvers. Play a Spider if you want to assist teammates and deal with other factions

### A devious Mastermind
The underworld may appear on the surface to be a chaotic array of warring factions and bloody deeds, but it has a beautiful order to those who are able to see it. This pattern is the web of connections, favors, vendettas, and secrets that bind the criminal world together. The scoundrels who pluck the strands of this web are known as Spiders.

When you play a Spider, you earn xp when you address a challenge with calculation or conspiracy. Reach out to your contacts, friends, and associates to set your crew up for success. Use your downtime activities and flashbacks wisely to prepare for trouble and to calculate the angles of success. When things go wrong, donâ€™t panic, and remember: you planned for this.

*Are you enmeshed in the network of favors and debts that you exploit as a Spider, or do you scrupulously hold yourself apart, as a cold predator upon the web?*
