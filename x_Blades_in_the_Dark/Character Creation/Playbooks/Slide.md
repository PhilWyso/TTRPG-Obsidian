Slides are good at social situations and subterfuge. Play a Slide if you want to manipulate and deceive people.

### A subtle manipulator and spy

It’s said that the primal substance of the world is not mere matter or strange plasms, it’s lies. Everything we do, everything we care about, everything we value—all lies we tell each other and ourselves. The world is a fabrication, a convenient fiction, a story—and the storytellers are Slides.

When you play a Slide, you earn xp when you address a challenge with deception or influence. Talk your way into trouble, then talk your way out again. Pretend to be someone you’re not. Bluff, lie, and manipulate to get your way. Every problem is ultimately a problem because of people—and people are the instrument upon which you play your music.

*Is there anything true about you, at your core? Or are you whatever you need to*
*be, day to day? Are all of your relationships merely gambits that you play for your*
*advantage?*
