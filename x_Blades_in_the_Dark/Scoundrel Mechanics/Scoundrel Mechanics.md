Here is a list of all the mechanics in Blades in the Dark

## Daring action
Deal with a dangerous obstacle by performing a daring action. Say what
your character does with one of the actions on your character sheet, along
with your goal. This is the name for rolling dice in the game.

When you're on the score, the GM introduces dangerous obstacles between you and your goals. Describe what your character does to address the obstacle - including one of the actions on your character sheet as the verb. Like, if there's a patrol in your way, you might say

	""I Prowl across the rooftops to avoid the Bluecoats and slip in
	through the skylight.‚Äù" 

By stating your actions this way, you avoid the problem of trying to use an action as if it's a broader skill. You simply say that you're performing the action itself. 
If you're not sure which action to use, think about your character's playbook, heritage and background. What do they know how to do? How do they address problems?

After you figure out what action the player is rolling with, the GM provides the following information before you roll:
- Potential Consequences
- The Position - your character's potential to lose
- The Effect - your character's potential to manipulate the situation on a success
	- Limited Effect - Little change to the circumstances
	- Standard Effect - Expected change to circumsta



### Get a Bonus Die
Get a bonus die for your roll by marking 2 stress to exert yourself or asking for a Devil's Bargain from the GM. A devil's bargain allows the GM to give you a guaranteed consequence in exchange for an extra dice for your roll.

### Help Someone
Help someone by marking 1 stress to give them +1d. Say how you help them. The GM may also cause the helper to cause consequences of a failed roll.

### Group Action
When you lead a group action, everyone involved rolls the same action and the highest result counts for everyone. You take 1 stress for each person who rolls 1-3

### Resistance
Roll Insight, Prowess or Resolve to avoid consequences. Take 6 stress, minus your highest die. This is your defensive option, you can risk stress to lower the consequence of an action.

### Greater Effect
Use a fine tool or weapon, push yourself, or trade position for effect.

### Flashback
Invent a cool move that your character did in the past in order to help you out in the present. The GM will charge you 0-3 stress, depending on how complex or tricky it is. Make an action roll if it's dangerous.
