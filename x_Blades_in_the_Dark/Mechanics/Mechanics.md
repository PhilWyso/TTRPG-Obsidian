Here is a list of all the mechanics in Blades in the Dark

## Daring action
Deal with a dangerous obstacle by performing a daring action. Say what
your character does with one of the actions on your character sheet, along
with your goal. This is the name for rolling dice in the game

### Get a Bonus Die
Get a bonus die for your roll by marking 2 stress or asking for a Devil's Bargain

### Help Someone
Help someone by marking 1 stress to give them +1d. Say how you help them

### Group Action
When you lead a group action, everyone involved rolls the same action and the highest result counts for everyone. You take 1 stress for each person who rolls 1-3

### Resistance
Roll Insight, Prowess or Resolve to avoid consequences. Take 6 stress, minus your highest die.

### Greater Effect
Use a fine tool or weapon, push yourself, or trade position for effect.

### Flashback
Invent a cool move that your character did in the past in order to help you out in the present. The GM will charge you 0-3 stress, depending on how complex or tricky it is. Make an action roll if it's dangerous.
